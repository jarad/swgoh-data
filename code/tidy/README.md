# Tidy scripts

These scripts are intended to read data from the 
[data/raw/](../../data/raw/) folder, tidy them up,
and write them to the 
[data/tidy/](../../data/tidy/) folder.
They are not intended to be run independently, but instead run through the
`run_all.R` script from the base of the repository.
